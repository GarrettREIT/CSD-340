                                    About Snowboarding paragraph 
                                    I have been going to Colorado since I was a little kid moving around the world. What started off 
                                    for a love of camping and hiking flourished into a love for cold weather sports. I grew up skiing 
                                    at the Garmisch Ski Resort in Southern Germany. Making our way back to the states we found ourselves 
                                    getting into snowboarding and making one or two trips to Keystone, CO every year. This is a photo of 
                                    me somewhere on the mountain on a snowy day where my beard is covered in ice.

                                    I have been involved in the cycling scene since my brother was old enough to be the support driver for 
                                    my Dad and Uncles Ragbrai Teams and eventually became a rider once I was legally allowed to drink. If 
                                    you know anything about cycling events or Ragbrai, it is all about riding all day and drinking along side.

                                    I grew up camping and hiking so the great outdoors have always been a passion of mine. I love IT but sometimes 
                                    you have to get away from the screen and the notifications and enjoy what nature has provided to us. This trip 
                                    to Baptist Draw was one for the books. I drove out there with my roommate to meet his friend who was living off 
                                    campgrounds in UT and another who came from Colorado. This group of friends was far more skilled than I was and 
                                    this was my first time in a slot canyon. I had no idea what I was getting myself into but had a bast and did not 
                                    die. That is rule number oneâ€¦ do not die, and no hospitals.

                            next think you know I have my real estate license and now working on my brokers license to manage our commercial sector. 
                            I do not sell too many homes myself but work with our agents on new softwares they can implement into their workflow. 
                            The photo below is of when I sold my first home in the heat of the pandemic. I sold it via FaceTime showings to a great

                            After my departure from healthcare I landed a job installing high end Audio Video equipment into residential homes and commercial buildings. 
                            We used Savant and Crestron for our integrations along with a variety of other products to turn a clients home into a smart home. Leaving 
                            this position I landed my position at the Real Estate Brokerage where I applied my IT and AV skills to get promoted to Head of IT at the 
                            brokerage where I test softwares, implement project management, IT support desk, and AV solutions. The photo is of a clients home IT/AV

                            After my first job working for a before and after school program/all day summer daycare I completed my Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) 
                            course and exam and got a job at at non-profit, QLI (Quality Living Inc.) as a RT (Rehabilitation Trainer) where I did direct care for 
                            patients recovering from Traumatic Brain Injures (TBI), Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI), and Stokes. The photo is of me, another staff and a 
                            patient who had a stroke, I was the lead hunter for the company and would take high functioning patients out hunting as a part of our 
                            Life Path Program. As my interest in the medical field grew I obtained my Medication Aide License which allowed me to work closely with 
                            nursing to give patients medication. Nursing was top of mind and I was promoted to Medical Coordinator where I was the liaison/patient 
                            advocate for all doctor appointments. I spent all my time meeting with doctors and patients at various hospitals and specialty clinics. 
                            Before I left QLI I was spearheading a new for profit Tele program called TeleRehabilitation where we brought Psychology, 
                            Speech & Language Pathology, Physical & Occupational Therapy to patients throughout the nation via iPad and Tele Services.
